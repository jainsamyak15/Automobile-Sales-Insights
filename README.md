# Automobile-Sales-Insights

# Project Description:
The "Automobile-Sales-Insights" repository provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and visualizing historical automobile sales data. It combines two powerful components: an interactive web dashboard and a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

The web dashboard, built with Python's Dash framework, offers an intuitive interface to explore yearly and recession-period statistics related to automobile sales. Users can visualize trends, analyze vehicle type performance, examine advertising expenditure, and investigate the impact of economic conditions on the automotive industry.

Complementing the dashboard, the Jupyter Notebook titled "Visualising Automobiles Sales Data" serves as a powerful tool for in-depth exploratory data analysis and visualization. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this notebook presents a wide range of insightful plots and charts, enabling users to uncover valuable insights from the historical automobile sales data.

Together, these components provide a comprehensive solution for data analysts, researchers, and automotive industry professionals to gain a deep understanding of automobile sales dynamics, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

# Components
1. Automobile Sales Analysis Dashboard
The Automobile Sales Analysis Dashboard is a Dash-powered web application that provides interactive visualizations and analysis of historical automobile sales data. It offers two main reporting modes: "Yearly Statistics" and "Recession Period Statistics." Users can explore yearly sales trends, monthly sales patterns, vehicle type performance, advertising expenditure, and the impact of economic conditions on the automotive industry.

2. Visualising Automobiles Sales Data
The "Visualising Automobiles Sales Data" Jupyter Notebook is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis and visualization tool. It leverages various Python libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to perform in-depth analysis and create insightful visualizations of the historical automobile sales data.

In this notebook, you can find a wide range of plots and charts, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, box plots, and more. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the relationships between different variables, such as sales, advertising expenditure, recession periods, unemployment rates, and vehicle types.

# Installation
Clone the repository:`git clone https://github.com/jainsamyak15/Automobile-Sales-Insights.git`
Install the required dependencies:`pip install -r requirements.txt requirement.txt`
# Usage
1.For the Automobile Sales Analysis Dashboard, follow the instructions in the README.md file within the dashboard directory.
2. For the "Visualising Automobiles Sales Data" Jupyter Notebook, open the notebook file using a compatible environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Visual Studio Code with the Python extension).
# Data
+ Both components use the `historical_automobile_sales.csv` dataset, which contains historical automobile sales data, including information such as year, month, vehicle type, automobile sales, advertising expenditure, recession periods, and unemployment rates.
